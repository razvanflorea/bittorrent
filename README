BitTorrent

This is a peer-to-peer application for downloading files from different sources.
The system consists in a server and multiple clients(peers). The server contains
all the information about the existing files in the system and about the peers 
that own these files. He is waiting for connections and for each client will
start a new thread for communication. The clients can upload or download files
from the system but they are also waiting for connections from other peers for
transferring pieces of files. All the transfer are made in parallel from
different peers.
The application can be run using the ant build file.
Example of running:
	- ant run-server
	- ant run-publish1
	- ant run-publish2
	- ant run-retrieve1
